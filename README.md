# Bias and Fairness Evaluation in Large Language Models

## Overview
This project identifies and mitigates biases in large language models (LLMs) to ensure fairness across demographic groups. It uses tools, frameworks, and datasets designed to evaluate stereotypes and improve the ethical deployment of LLMs.

## Features
- **Bias Detection**: Evaluate LLMs using datasets like StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs.
- **Fairness Metrics**: Measure fairness using tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 and Fairlearn.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Experiment with data-level, model-level, and inference-level strategies.
- **Automation**: Scripts for automated bias detection and mitigation.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration.
- `models/`: Pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for automation and experimentation.
- `results/`: Logs, visualizations, and evaluation summaries.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for scripts and methods.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
